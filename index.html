  <h2>The Fox and the Crow</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>A crow having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it in her
beak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat himself, and by a
wily stratagem succeeded. “How handsome is the Crow,” he exclaimed, “in
the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion! Oh,
if her voice were only equal to her beauty, she would deservedly be
considered the Queen of Birds!” This he said deceitfully; but the Crow,
anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw
and dropped the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed
the Crow</p>

<p class="fable-moral">"My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is wanting"

  <div class="titre"><h2>The Traveler and His Dog</h2></div>
    <p>A traveler about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the
door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: “Why do you stand there
gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.” The
Dog, wagging his tail, replied: “O, master! I am quite ready; it is you
for whom I am waiting.”</p>

<p class="fable-moral">"The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend"</p>

    <h2>The Farmer and the Cranes</h2>

    <p>Some cranes made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with
wheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased
them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the
sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of it
and would not move. The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with
stones, and killed a great number. The remaining birds at once forsook
his fields, crying to each other, “It is time for us to be off to
Liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to
show us in earnest what he can do.”</p>

<p class="fable-moral">"If words suffice not, blows must follow"</p>
